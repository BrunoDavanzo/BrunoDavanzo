### Hi there, welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋

My name is Bruno Davanzo, I am from SP-Brazil. After working some years as salesman, and I decided to move to another country for cultural exchange to improve my language skills.
I spent over 2 years living in Ireland, working with several type os jobs and studying. When I returned to Brazil, and a programmer friend started telling me about what she does at work and I liked it. So I decided to start studying Web development too, and now I am passionate about programming and technology.

On my free time I love watching Netflix, 🎬 specially old movies, play with my dogs, visit new places, go out friends 🍻, etc.

I'm also on LinkedIn
